# Scheduler
An automatic timetable scheduler for school.
The faculty admin schedules the timetable and also adds the departmental admins.
The departmental admin adds the courses, the number of students offering the course, etc.
The scheduler works by selecting the courses, setting different time for exams, making sure that no course by the same level falls into same time and also making sure that the capacity of the selected hall is not lesser than the number of students offering the course.
